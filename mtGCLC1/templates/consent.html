                    This research is being conducted by Dr. Julia Strand at Carleton College 
                    in Northfield, Minnesota.  We are investigating how people perceive spoken 
                    words in sentences. During the study, you will be asked to find a quiet place
                     and listen to spoken sentences.  Then, you will be asked to identify 
                    some of the words that you hear by typing them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The study will take about 30 minutes of your time and you will be paid $5.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    There are no direct risks to you for participating in this study and no direct 
                    benefits other than compensation for your time and adding to our scientific knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p>Your data will be de-identified as soon as data collection is complete so your 
                    results will not be able to be linked with you. </p>

                    <p>Your participation is voluntary: if you change your mind about participating, you 
                    may stop at any time without penalty.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any 
                    questions, concerns or comments about the project.</p>
