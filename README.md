# Conducting spoken word recognition research online: Validation and a new timing method
######Joseph Slote and Julia F. Strand
## Experiment 1

This is the code repository for Experiment One of the [above-titled study](https://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/psyc/jstrand/assets/Slote_and_Strand_BRM.pdf). The experiment is designed to be run using [psiTurk](https://psiturk.org/) version 2.1.1 on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform.

Of particular interest are the following features
- Cursor auto-hiding during experiment proper (see shycursor.js)
- Audio preloading including a progress bar popup
- Fullscreen requirement to mitigate distraction: participants are asked to enter fullscreen and the experiment is paused (all input blocked) if they exit prematurely
- Basic flow control
- Audio reCaptcha integration
