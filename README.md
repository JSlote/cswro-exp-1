# Conducting spoken word recognition research online: Validation and a new timing method
######Joseph Slote and Julia F. Strand
## Experiment 1

This is the code repository for Experiment One of the [above-titled study](https://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/psyc/jstrand/assets/Slote_and_Strand_BRM.pdf). The experiment is designed to be run using [psiTurk](https://psiturk.org/) version 2.1.1 on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform.

Of general interest are the following features:
- Cursor auto-hiding during experiment proper,
- Audio preloading including a progress bar pop-up,
- Fullscreen requirement to mitigate distraction (participants are asked to enter fullscreen and the experiment is paused (all input blocked) if they exit prematurely),
- Basic asynchronous flow control for transitioning between stages of the experiment,
- and Audio reCaptcha integration (you will have to input your reCaptcha keys in custom.py and task.js for this feature to function).
